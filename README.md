# Python-workspace

A series of short scripts that help in media (e.g. video or image files) management.

### Copy Heirarchy
Copies file(s) from one directory to another while maintaining the original directory structure. If the destination does not match the directory structure of the source, it creates a new one.

### quick-DPX-lores
Converts DPX images to lower-res JPG files for quick viewing. For easy access, it creates a subfolder in the same directory as the root of the DPX images.

### textFileContentCompiler_with_gui
Scans through a list of text files and compiles the content of each file in a word document. Each file name becomes a heading and the content becomes a paragraph below the heading.

### thumbs
Provides a convenient way to quickly go through multiple videos without actually viewing them.

- Scans through video files in a directory.   
- Grabs a beginning, middle and an ending frame of the each video file.   
- Transcribes the name of the file, timestamp and frame number and the image sequence. (01 if beginning, 02 if mid and 03 if ending frame).   
- Saves each image as a low-resolution JPG file.
