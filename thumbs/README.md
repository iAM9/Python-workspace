Provides a convenient way to quickly go through multiple videos without actually viewing them.

- Scans through video files in a directory.   
- Grabs a beginning, middle and an ending frame of the each video file.   
- Transcribes the name of the file, timestamp and frame number and the image sequence. (01 if beginning, 02 if mid and 03 if ending frame).   
- Saves each image as a low-resolution JPG file.
